# README

snAppy is a VS Code extension coupled with an interactive view to support your React front-end delivery. It automates dynamic and vendor code-splitting all within your workspace.  

## Features

snAppy includes Webpack configuration and bundling, automated dynamic/vendor code-splitting, and exporting of webpack.config.js and bundle report files. snAppy works on top of your code base, never deleting your code and you may choose to keep/delete any changes made.

## Extension Settings

Pull down the Command Palette and search: snAppy: Start on Current Workspace

Turn on auto-save to allow for rebundle of your application after optimizations have been made. You may still undo any changes afterwards.
